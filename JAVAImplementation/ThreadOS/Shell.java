  Task: This assignment is designed to help you understand that,
        from the kernelâ€™s viewpoint, the shell is simply an application
        program that uses system calls to spawn and to terminate other
        user programs. You will also get familiar with our ThreadOS
        operating system simulator through the assignment.
